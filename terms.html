            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>
            
            <p>Welcome to Replex. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Replex mobile application ("App") and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using Replex, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Use License</h2>
            <p>Permission is granted to download and use Replex for personal, non-commercial use only, subject to an active subscription. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
                <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display</li>
                <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
                <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials</li>
                <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Access to Replex requires an active subscription.</strong> A 7-day free trial is available for new users. After the trial period, continued access requires a paid subscription. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions, if your subscription expires or is cancelled, or may be terminated by us at any time.</p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. You are responsible for safeguarding the password and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
            <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions.</p>

            <h2>4. User Content</h2>
            <p>Replex allows you to create, store, and manage workout data, exercise information, and related content ("User Content"). You retain all rights to your User Content. By using the App, you grant us a license to use, store, and process your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's services.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. You represent and warrant that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You own or have the necessary rights to use and authorize us to use your User Content</li>
                <li>Your User Content does not violate any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights</li>
                <li>Your User Content does not contain any unlawful, harmful, or offensive material</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your use of Replex is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
            <p>Replex uses iCloud and CloudKit to synchronize your data across your devices. By using the App, you consent to the storage and synchronization of your data through Apple's iCloud services, subject to Apple's terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>6. Prohibited Uses</h2>
            <p>You may not use Replex:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In any way that violates any applicable national or international law or regulation</li>
                <li>To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material without our prior written consent</li>
                <li>To impersonate or attempt to impersonate the company, a company employee, another user, or any other person or entity</li>
                <li>In any way that infringes upon the rights of others, or in any way is illegal, threatening, fraudulent, or harmful</li>
                <li>To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the App</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Replex and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The information on this App and the App itself are provided on an "as is" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Replex excludes all representations, warranties, conditions, and terms relating to our App and the use of this App (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law in respect of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose, and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).</p>
            <p><strong>Replex is not a medical or health service provider.</strong> The App is intended for informational and tracking purposes only. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or fitness program.</p>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall Replex, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the App.</p>

            <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Replex and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of your use and access of the App, or a breach of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>11. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms or expiration or cancellation of your subscription.</p>
            <p>If your subscription expires or is cancelled, your access to the App will be terminated. Your workout data will remain stored in iCloud and will be accessible again if you resubscribe.</p>
            <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may cancel your subscription through your App Store account settings and delete the App from your device.</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our App after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the App.</p>

            <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the App is operated, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

            <h2>14. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
            
            <h3>14.1 Subscription Model</h3>
            <p>Replex operates on a subscription-based model. Access to the App requires an active subscription. We offer Monthly and Annual subscription options. All subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store and are subject to Apple's standard subscription terms and conditions.</p>
            
            <h3>14.2 Free Trial</h3>
            <p>New users are eligible for a 7-day free trial period. During the trial, you have full access to all features of the App. A payment method (credit card) is required to start the trial, as required by Apple's App Store policies. The trial automatically converts to a paid subscription at the end of the 7-day period unless cancelled before the trial expires. You may cancel the trial at any time through your App Store account settings without being charged - if you cancel during the trial period, your subscription will not start and you will not be charged.</p>
            
            <h3>14.3 Subscription Plans</h3>
            <p>We offer the following subscription plans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monthly Subscription:</strong> Billed monthly, automatically renews unless cancelled</li>
                <li><strong>Annual Subscription:</strong> Billed annually, automatically renews unless cancelled</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Subscription prices are displayed in the App Store and may vary by region. Prices are subject to change, but any price changes will not affect your current subscription period.</p>
            
            <h3>14.4 Auto-Renewal</h3>
            <p>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will be charged the subscription fee to your App Store account within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal at any time through your App Store account settings.</p>
            
            <h3>14.5 Cancellation</h3>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your App Store account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will continue to have access to the App until then. If you cancel during the free trial period, you will not be charged.</p>
            
            <h3>14.6 Refunds</h3>
            <p>Refunds are handled in accordance with Apple's App Store refund policy. Generally, refunds are not available for subscription fees already paid, except as required by law. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact Apple Support or us directly. We may, at our discretion, provide refunds in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            
            <h3>14.7 Subscription Management</h3>
            <p>All subscription management, including cancellation, renewal, and payment, is handled through your Apple App Store account. To manage your subscription, go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions on your iPhone. We do not have direct access to modify or cancel subscriptions on your behalf.</p>
            
            <h3>14.8 Access Upon Subscription Expiration</h3>
            <p>If your subscription expires or is cancelled, you will lose access to the App's features. Your workout data will remain stored in iCloud and will be accessible again if you resubscribe. We are not responsible for any loss of access or data due to subscription expiration or cancellation.</p>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our App, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the App.</p>
