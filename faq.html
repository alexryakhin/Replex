                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Replex offers a 7-day free trial so you can experience all features before committing. After the trial period, a subscription is required to continue using the app. We offer both Monthly and Annual subscription options. Subscriptions are managed through the App Store, and you can cancel at any time.

                    <div class="faq-question">What subscription options are available?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Replex offers two subscription options: Monthly and Annual. Both subscriptions unlock all features of the app. The Annual subscription provides better value with a discount compared to the monthly plan. All subscriptions include a 7-day free trial period. You can manage your subscription through your App Store account settings.

                    <div class="faq-question">How does the free trial work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        When you first download Replex, you'll receive a 7-day free trial that gives you full access to all features. A payment method (credit card) is required to start the trial, as required by Apple's App Store policies. At the end of the 7-day period, you'll need to subscribe to continue using the app. You can cancel anytime during the trial period and you won't be charged - the trial will end and your subscription won't start. If you don't cancel, the trial automatically converts to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens when my subscription expires?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Replex uses a subscription model where access to the app requires an active subscription. If your subscription expires or is cancelled, you will no longer be able to access the app's features. Your workout data remains stored in iCloud and will be accessible again if you resubscribe. We recommend managing your subscription through the App Store to ensure uninterrupted access.

                        Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time through your App Store account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period, so you'll continue to have access until then. If you cancel during the free trial period, you won't be charged. Refunds are handled according to Apple's App Store refund policy. For subscription management, go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions on your iPhone.

You can manage iCloud sync through your device's Settings app under iCloud.

                        You can delete the app from your device, which will remove all local data. If you have iCloud sync enabled, you may also need to delete the data from your iCloud account through your device's Settings.
